## Background
### Idea Inspiration
<div style="text-align: justify">
The concept of our app was sparked off by the desire of a very prominent matter to
everybody, saving time. It can be rather time-consuming to manually prioritise and
schedule our tasks around events that we have planned each day. Generally, it takes
about 2 hours (but not limited to) weekly for individuals to plan their weekly 
schedules as well as their tasks, weekly it doesn't seem to be a long time considering
we have 168 hours each week, and it only takes up only above 10% of our time. However,
cumulatively, the amount of time spent could actually be used more efficiently, especially
for individuals like us, students. 

As students, juggling numerous commitments can often feel overwhelming. The arduous
task of manually organising and prioritising tasks around existing events not only
consumes precious time but also adds unnecessary stress to already packed schedules.

Which lead to us thinking, what if there was a solution to alleviate this burden?
(Similar to how **JARVIS** plans schedules for **Tony**). We wanted an app that automates
the entire process of task scheduling, revolutionising time management for students.
With this innovative tool, everybody, not only students, can effortlessly input
their tasks, and the app will seamlessly integrate them into their calendar, optimising
schedules to maximise productivity and efficiency.

Inspired by this desire, our team envisioned an app that would one day be able to
intake human-like natural language and be able to generate tasks required,
automatically scheduling it based on its priority. Harnessing the power of automation,
our app aims to empower not only students but everybody to focus more on other important aspects
like your passions, while minimising the hassle of manual adjustments. Thus, our
idea was sparked: **EDITH** a.k.a **E**vents & **D**eadlines **I**ntelligent
**T**ask **H**andler; an intuitive app designed to revolutionise time management
for everybody, saving them valuable time and energy to devote to what truly matters.
